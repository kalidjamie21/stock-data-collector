# stock-data-collector
A python script that collects US stock data and outputs useful information for analytical engagement

The program uses the Alpha Vantage API to fetch financial data and tabulates it within the console. Output is
exportable to Excel. 

Only issue: data is inconsistent perhaps due to the AV infrastructure. Error messages pop up at times, while at other times, 
the script works fine. Need to look into this...
